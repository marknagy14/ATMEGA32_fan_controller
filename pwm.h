* The function responsible for trigger the Timer0 with the PWM Mode.
* Setup the PWM mode with Non-Inverting.
* Setup the prescaler with F_CPU/8.
* Setup the compare value based on the required input duty cycleâž¢ Setup the direction for OC0 as output pin through the GPIO driver.
* The generated PWM signal frequency will be 500Hz to control the DC
* Motor speed. */
